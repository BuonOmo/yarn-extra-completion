# yarn-extra-completion

This plugin is greatly inspired by [zsh-better-npm-completion](https://github.com/lukechilds/zsh-better-npm-completion). It works the same way, as you can see with `npm` demo:

* Makes `yarn add` recommendations from npm cache,
* Makes `yarn remove` recommendations from `dependencies`/`devDependencies`,
* Shows detailed information on script contents for `npm run`,
* Calls already installed yarn completion for any other command.

# Pre-requisites

You'll need [jq](https://stedolan.github.io/jq/download/).

It is strongly suggested that you also have the default yarn suggestion under
the name of `_yarn`. Or that you set `YARN_EXTRA_COMPLETION_DEFAULT=_your_default_function`.
